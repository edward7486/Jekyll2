<h4>1. Understand the users</h4>

Goal-based design is at the heart of how I operate. I adhere to Alan Cooper's 'goal-based design', discovering and unearthing what and why users use your product or service for. I utilize direct user interviews and/or contextual inquiry to fully immerse myself in the user's domain. Personas are a key design artifact to share empathy among stakeholders once goals, behaviors, pains, and needs are learned. I love utilizing scenarios (or storyboards) and journey maps where appropriate to fully communicate and understand a user's tasks and interactions.

<i>In some cases, full-on research is not possible</i>, for any number of reasons: budget, timing, other inter-personal issues. In these cases, I typically employ a lean UX methodology that includes catalogging what I know about the problem, and logging assumptions to be tested with users directly. Logging assumptions helps me validate the assumptions, problem, and solution with users.    

<h4>2. Ideate and refine</h4>
        
With a strong understanding of the user, generating many ideas with a diverge - converge method is ideal. I like to work collaboratively across the organization to share design concepts with stakeholders or team members closely familiar with the design problem at hand. At this stage I like thinking about pros and cons of a particular design, and logging questions I might still have to ask users in user testing. In the past, I've developed prototypes using HTML/CSS, but also tools like UXPin or Invision to be used in usability testing with users. Assessing a design with users is a great way to determine if it solves their problem and provides value.

<h4>3. Ship and monitor</h4>

Once a design is refined, I typically red-line or create spec documents to hand off to the engineering teams. I enjoy working closely to make the design become a reality.

After shipping, close monitoring to examine usage, and follow-up interviews with users of the feature or product are key to determine if the approach is on-track.
