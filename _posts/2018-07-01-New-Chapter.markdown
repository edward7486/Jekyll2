<p>I recently left LiquidPlanner - I company I hold close to my heart. They took a chance on a hungry guy coming fresh out of grad school. They gave me opportunities to learn, lead, and grow. I couldn't have asked for a better place to start my career. I will miss the people the most!</p>

<p>With no job, I finally have time to sit down and think about how I want to update my portfolio. My goal was really to communicate my design process, and to think critically about my case studies. I hope you'll give those a read if you're interested in my work.</p>

<p>Thank you for stopping by!</p>
